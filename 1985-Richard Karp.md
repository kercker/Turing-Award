#Richard Karp
## Citation
  * For his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to the theory of NP-completeness. Karp introduced the now standard methodology for proving problems to be NP-complete which has led to the identification of many theoretical and practical problems as being computationally difficult.

### Quotes
  * Three Principles in Making Career Choices
   * Understand what you are good at and what you like to do, and choose accordingly. In the words of Socrates, “Know thyself.”
   * Disregard the fashions of the day and search for the new areas of research that are about to become important. In the words of the great hockey player and philosopher Wayne Gretzky, “Skate to where the puck is gonna be.”
   * To find exciting problems, look at the interfaces between disciplines.
